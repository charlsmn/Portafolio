As a UI designer and developer, I had the honor of creating the app for the Distrito Lasallista de Bogotá, a tool that combines intuitive design and robust functionality to serve the Lasallista community. This app, developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) in WordPress and designed in Figma, is available on both the iOS AppStore and the Android PlayStore.

### Key Features

-   **Liturgical Calendar:** I integrated an interactive liturgical calendar that allows users to easily keep track of important events and dates.
-   **PDF Reading:** I implemented a PDF reading feature optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth reading experience for books and documents.
-   **Songbooks:** I designed a songbook section that provides easy access to songs and lyrics, perfect for use in events and celebrations.
-   **Videos and Audios:** I added support for multimedia content, allowing users to watch videos and listen to inspiring audios directly from the app.
-   **User Registration and Profile:** I created a user registration and profile management system, offering a personalized and secure experience for each user.
-   **Library:** I developed a digital library where users can search for and access a wide variety of resources, from prayers and psalms to articles and books.

The app's interface was designed with a focus on usability and user experience, ensuring that people of all ages can easily navigate and utilize its features. Using Figma enabled efficient collaboration and rapid iteration during the design process, while WordPress as the technological foundation ensured smooth integration and reliable performance.
