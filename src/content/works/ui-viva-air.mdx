This project involved a comprehensive UI/UX design for Viva Air, focusing on improving the user interface and experience of their website. The design work did not include web development but was pivotal in enhancing the overall user journey for ticket purchasing and the homepage.

### Key Features

-   Ticket Purchasing Process: The entire interface for the ticket purchasing process was redesigned to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. The new design simplifies seat selection, personal information entry, and payment steps, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience for users.
-   Enhanced UX/UI: By focusing on user experience and interface design, the project aimed to make the website more accessible and easier to navigate. This included clear visual hierarchies, intuitive navigation paths, and streamlined forms to reduce user friction.
-   New Homepage Design: A fresh, engaging homepage was created to better reflect Viva Air's brand and improve user engagement. The new design features prominent calls to action, eye-catching visuals, and a well-organized layout that highlights key services and promotions.
-   Responsive Design: Ensuring the design is fully responsive was crucial. The new UI adapts seamlessly across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones, providing an optimal user experience regardless of how customers access the site.
-   Visual Consistency: The redesign ensured visual consistency across all pages, with a cohesive color scheme, typography, and iconography that align with Viva Air's branding.
